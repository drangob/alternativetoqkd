Look into using wireguard PSK with the system. 
	PSK is inserted into wireguard - this is mixed into the key when rekeying is done - 
		We specify the PSK in a file. is this file pulled into the rekeying mechanism on each rekey?
		If this is the case - 
			reducing the constants of the rekeying time, then updating the PSK file on each side of the transmission in sync to keep using our random bitstream.
	Regardless, we need to fill a single file with 256 bits for wireguard


Deletion of used data
	secure deletion of data isnt very easy
	Could be tempted to use GNU "shred" on an already used file once we are done with it - this will ONLY work if we have disabled the journalling on ext4
		Disbaling the journal is easily done. Therefore this is decent idea.
		We can even shred a specified number of bytes! This is very useful


Modes of operation:
	Provide keys = (Wireguard keys).
	File one time pad.

Multiple sources of randomness - different trust levels
