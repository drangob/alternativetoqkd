We can use the 'time' program on linux to work out the speed of doing commands
Using this to benchmark different filesystem layouts.

Filled folder with 50,000 tiny numbered txt files.

Accessing 1.txt takes the same amount of time as 31307.txt. 
This shows when we know the file we are looking for, we access it very quickly, regardless of sequential or random access.
1:
real	0m0.002s
31307:
real	0m0.002s

Seeking to the middle of a 100mb file does not seem to have any significant performance issue.

Random Access Took 0.000083s
Sequential Access Took 0.000088s
Random Access Took 0.000150s
Sequential Access Took 0.000110s
Random Access Took 0.000109s
Sequential Access Took 0.000098s
