Intel RdRand has a high maximum throughput at 800 MB/sec.
Note though that a single thread will see a throughput of 70 to 200MB/sec

Intel RdRand found to be robust and is unlikely to provide insecure randomness
due to the usage of a von Neumann corrector. 
"the most likely failure modes cause the output to be “stuck” in one state 
(e.g., stuck on), causing no output from the von Neumann corrector."
Jun, B. and Kocher, P. "The Intel Random Number Generator" Cryptography Research, Inc., April 1999

Much talk about possible backdoors and trojans into Intels TRNG, 
"Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans" found that it is possible to insert a 
Trojan into the TRNG without detection. 
"Since optical reverse-engineering is not feasible and our Trojan
passes functional testing, a verifier cannot distinguish a Trojan design from a
Trojan-free design."

Intel's David Johnston states "I’ve examined my own RNG with electron microscopes and
picoprobes. So I and a number of test engineers know full well that
the design hasn’t been subverted."

Due to the risk of an undetected hardware trojan it's preferable that the Intel
TRNG is not the sole source of entropy in the system.
